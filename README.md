rrrrradio-ios
===

The rrrrradio iOS app is an interface for the [rrrrradio](http://github.com/amsoell/rrrrradio) streaming music server for your iPhone or iPad. It allows you to listen along to the music when you're on the go, as well as queue up your own tracks and see who else is listening.

_**NOTE:**_ Rdio, the music provider for the rrrrradio streaming service, has disabled OAuth 1.0 as of June 30, 2015. The iOS app is being updated for the new OAuth 2.0 specifications, but is still in development. The server component, however, has been fully updated and is ready to be deployed! Keep an eye here (or on the [OAuth2](https://github.com/amsoell/rrrrradio-ios/tree/oauth2) branch) for updates.
